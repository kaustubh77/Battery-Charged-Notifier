# Battery-Charged-Notifier

Ever wanted your laptop to notify you to unplug the charger after it has been charged? To increase the battery life of my laptop I wrote this simple python script that notifies me regarding my battery charging status either through terminal or a beep sound when it is about to get charged or through a mobile push notification. I have used Notify-run API to send push notifications to all devices which are subscribed to the users channel.
